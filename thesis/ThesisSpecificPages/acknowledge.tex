I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude towards \textbf{Prof. Anshul Kumar}, my Ph.D. supervisor. I interacted with him a few months before joining the Ph.D. programme and he has been advising me in various aspects right through then. Not only has he been a technical mentor, he has provided great insights on many other aspects of an academic life which would be useful for the future. I would also like to thank my supervisor \textbf{Prof. Kolin Paul} for providing practical insights and inputs on my thesis work. He has always been available for discussions and suggestions and pushed me to write the thesis in time. Both my supervisors have been very supportive during a few hard times in my research and have always motivated me. They actively helped me to complete the thesis during the COVID-19 related lockdown.
