This is to certify that the thesis titled ``\textbf{OPTIMIZING NEURAL NETWORKS
	PERFORMANCE ON PARALLEL
	ARCHITECTURES}'' being submitted by  \textbf{Saurabh Tewari} for the award of \textbf{Doctor of Philosophy} in Computer Science and Engineering is a record of bonafide work carried out by him  under my guidance and supervision in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. The work presented in this thesis has not been submitted elsewhere, either in part or full, for the award of any other degree or diploma unless otherwise stated explicitly. 

Certain works included in this thesis involved collaboration or use of measurement data obtained by other students, which have been explicitly specified/acknowledged in the corresponding chapters and the part done by those collaborators appeared in their respective reports/theses.
%In particular, work done in Chapters 2 and 4 were done jointly with undergraduate students. In each case, the part done by the collaborators appeared in their respective Bachelor's theses.
